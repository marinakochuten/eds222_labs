## Estimating logistic regression coefficients

### Model and likelihood function

Given the logistic regression model:

$$
\begin{align}
y &\sim Bernoulli(p) \\
logit(p) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
\end{align}
$$

What's the likelihood of some values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$?

Recall our likelihood function is:

$$
L(\beta_0, \beta_1) = \prod_i PMF(y_i, p_i)
$$

Where $PMF(y_i, p_i)$ is the value of the Bernoulli probability mass function with probability $p_i$ at $y_i$. E.g., $PMF(1, 0.5)=0.5$, $PMF(0, 0.75)=0.25$, and $PMF(1, 0.1)=0.1$.

### Simulate some data

```{r}
# Simulate some values for x

# Choose our betas

# Calculate p across x 

# Simulate y
# Note: rbinom() with size = 1 is equivalent to a random Bernoulli variable

# Visualize

```

### Likelihood of a few options

Calculate the likelihood of:

-   $\beta_0=-5$, $\beta_1 = 1$

-   $\beta_0=-1$, $\beta_1 = 0$

-   $\beta_0=-3$, $\beta_1 = 0.5$

```{r}
# Write our likelihood function 
# Note this uses the x and y values we generated earlier!
# We're looking for the likelihood of the parameters given the data.

# Apply the likelihood function to some candidate coefficients

```

### Likelihood of a lot of options

Calculate the likelihood of 1,000,000 combinations of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ in the ranges $\beta_0 \in [-5, 0]$ and $\beta_1 \in [-1, 2]$.

```{r}
# Create a data frame with combinations of beta0, beta1
 # Apply the likelihood function using mapply()

# Isolate the parameters with the maximum likelihood

# Visualize!

```

Our estimates for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ chosen by maximum likelihood are `r #round(max_likelihood$beta0, 3)` and `r #round(max_likelihood$beta1, 3)`, respectively. Compare those to the values we used in our simulation: -3 and 0.75.
